# HA Havvarsel
HA Havvarsel is an AppDaemon app which will provide current sea temperature model data and prognosis from the Norwegian Institute for Marine Research 
(Havforskningsinstituttet).

This standalone python app for AppDaemon will create a sensor for the sea temperature at 
the specified location. 
To use it you will use the Home Assistant addons appdaemon and mqtt and install this python app
for appdaemon. This method may initially seem 
complicated but installation *should* be straightforward and the solution gives the best results out of all the methods that I tried.

## Installation

To install the codes you must follow these steps:

1. install the mosquitto broker add on for home assistant. To do this go to the add-ons configuration section and select the mosquitto broker from the list of official addons.

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add-on store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_store.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_store/)

   Install mosquitto and configure it.

1. You will need the MQTT integration from the integrations page:
   
   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=mqtt)

1. Now install the appdaemon addon which is available form the addon store.

-----------------------------------------
The script "havvarsel.py" is an app for AppDaemon that periodically fetches the current sea temperature
for the specified location. A sensor is created by posting to a create topic on the MQTT server. The data is updated 
by posting to a topic that was specified in the create payload. The payloads are constructed so that your Home Assistant
instance will auto-discover the sensor and it will be available for display.

Copy the files in the folder ```havvarsel``` to your appdaemon app folder. It will probably be in something like: ```/addon_configs/a0d7b954_appdaemon/apps```, you will need 
to upload the file yourself, or copy/paste using an editor.

Then configure the app in the ```apps.yml``` file located in the AppDaemon apps folder. Similar to the following:

```yaml
havvarsel_nordnes:
  module: havvarsel
  class: HavvarselRest
  log_level: INFO
  device: Havvarsel
  manufacturer: IMR, Norway
  longitude: 5.302337
  latitude: 60.398942
  sensor_name: Nordnes sea temperature
  unit_of_measurement: Â°C
```

 - ```module```, and ```class``` are mandatory and must be written as shown
 - ```log_level``` can be INFO or DEBUG and is optional
 - ```device``` is the name your HA device wil get
 - ```manufacturer``` is optional and displayed for the device to show the data provider
 - ```longitude``` and ```latitude``` are the location on the Norwegian coast where you want the forecast from
 - ```sensor_name``` will be the name of the sensor in your instance
 - ```unit_of_measurement``` is optional and overrides the units provided by the underlying rest service.
 
 When you save the ```app.yaml``` file in your configuration, AppDaemon will start the havvarsel app. 

Note that the app script specifies that MQTT topics should be retained. This is to ensure continuity between restarts
of HA (otherwise the sensors become unavailable). MQTT retention can be tricky, and if something goes wrong, or you want to remove a line/sensor, then 
it will most likely be retained. This may mean that old line sensors are still available after you have 
removed them from the configuration. There is currently no automatic purge to remove previous configurations (but see below).

------------------------------------------
If you should use a configuration that created a  sensor that you no longer need, the sensor will continue to exist even if you remove it from the configuration. This is due to
message retention in the mosquitto broker. The current method to remove unwanted sensor is to access the mosquitto broker using MQTT Explorer (take a look here https://community.home-assistant.io/t/addon-mqtt-explorer-new-version/603739). If you connect MQTT Explorer to your broker, you can delete the unwanted topics there:
